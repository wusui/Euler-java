/**
 * Implementations of problems to be solved.  All classes in this package
 * are named problemXXX where XXX is the problem number under Project Euler.
 * All classes implement an EulerProb interface  problem() function.  In many
 * cases, that function will be a wrapper that just passes a parameter to the
 * actual implementation.
 * <p>
 * The main function in each of these classes just passes a new instance of
 * this class to Etimer.run_function.
